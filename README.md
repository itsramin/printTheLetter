# Revive the Art of Letter Writing 🖋️

Welcome to **Revive the Art of Letter Writing**, a unique web application that brings back the charm of physical letters in a fun and mysterious way! This tool allows you to upload a handwritten letter as an image, divide it into multiple parts, and generate a PDF. The receiver must print all pages of the PDF on a **single sheet of paper** and overlay them to reveal the original message. It’s a modern twist on the classic art of letter writing!
